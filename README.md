# Infra-as-Code-with-Kubernetes

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a cloud-native infrastructure on Microsoft Azure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and Kubernetes (AKS). The infrastructure is designed to be secure, scalable, and highly available.

## Key Components
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Container Orchestration**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Networking**: Azure Front Door, Application Gateway, Private Endpoints, Private DNS Zones
- **Security**: Azure Key Vault, Network Security Groups (NSGs), RBAC
- **Data Services**: Azure PostgreSQL, Redis Cache, Storage Accounts
- **Compute**: Azure Virtual Machines
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, Kubernetes Manifests, Helm
- **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Initialize and apply Terraform scripts.
3. Deploy applications to AKS.
4. Configure Jenkins for CI/CD.

# Infra-as-Code-with-Kubernetes
Project Description: Infra-as-Code with Kubernetes
Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a cloud-native infrastructure on Microsoft Azure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and Kubernetes (AKS). The infrastructure is designed to be secure, scalable, and highly available, leveraging Azureâ€™s managed services and modern DevOps practices.

Key Components
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform:

Automated the provisioning of Azure resources using Terraform.

Managed infrastructure lifecycle, including creation, updates, and destruction.

Used Terraform modules for reusable and modular infrastructure code.

Private AKS Cluster:

Deployed a private Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster for container orchestration.

Configured private endpoints and private DNS zones to ensure secure communication within the virtual network.

Enabled RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and integrated with Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication.

Networking and Security:

Set up Azure Front Door for global load balancing and traffic routing.

Configured Azure Application Gateway as an ingress controller for the AKS cluster.

Secured sensitive data using Azure Key Vault for secrets management.

Implemented private endpoints for secure access to Azure services like Storage Accounts, PostgreSQL, and Redis Cache.

Data and Caching:

Deployed Azure Redis Cache for high-performance caching.

Provisioned Azure PostgreSQL as a managed relational database service.

Used Azure Storage Accounts for blob storage and file shares.

Virtual Machines (VMs):

Deployed Azure Virtual Machines for workloads that cannot be containerized.

Configured network security groups (NSGs) and private endpoints for secure VM access.

CI/CD Integration:

Integrated with Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

Automated the deployment of applications to the AKS cluster using Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts.

Monitoring and Logging:

Configured Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for monitoring infrastructure and application performance.

Set up alerts and dashboards for proactive issue detection.
